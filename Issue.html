Women also play key roles in creating peaceful and stable societies as important factors for economic growth. Unfortunately, these benefits have not been universally recognized and have therefore not translated into women-s full economic participation. Women still face obstacles when trying to establish new businesses or expand existing ones. Among the biggest hurdles are discriminatory laws, regulations and business conditions, as well as women's lack of access to property rights, finance, training, technology, markets, mentors, and networks.
